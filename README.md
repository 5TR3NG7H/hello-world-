Now it is Ok I was writing to master 

I would suggest to change below description for such as dummies like me with Zero coding experience 

Make and commit changes

first line should be :
Choose your branche - >readme-edits
Click the README.md file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes button.
